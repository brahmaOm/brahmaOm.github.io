    <p>Steve Jobs was an American entrepreneur, inventor, and industrial designer who was the co-founder, chairman, and CEO of Apple Computer. Jobs was widely recognized as a pioneer of the digital revolution, and he was often called the "father of the personal computer."
        
        <br>
        
        Jobs was born in San Francisco, California, on February 24, 1955. He was adopted by Clara and Paul Jobs, a working-class couple who lived in Cupertino, California. Jobs was a bright and inquisitive child, and he excelled in school. He was also interested in electronics and computers, and he spent many hours tinkering with them in his garage.
        <br>
        
        After graduating from high school, Jobs attended Reed College in Portland, Oregon. However, he dropped out after six months, feeling that the college was not meeting his expectations. He then spent the next two years traveling around the world, taking odd jobs and studying Buddhism.
        <br>
        In 1975, Jobs returned to California and got a job at Atari, a video game company. He soon met Steve Wozniak, a talented engineer who was working on a prototype for a personal computer. Jobs and Wozniak founded Apple Computer in 1976, and they introduced their first computer, the Apple I, at the Altair Computer Show in Palo Alto, California.
        <br>
        
        The Apple I was a success, and Jobs and Wozniak quickly followed it up with the Apple II, a more user-friendly computer that was designed for the home market. The Apple II was a huge success, and it helped to make Apple Computer one of the most successful companies in the world.
        
        <br>
        In 1984, Apple introduced the Macintosh, a groundbreaking personal computer that was designed to be easy to use by anyone. The Macintosh was a major success, and it helped to establish Apple as a leader in the personal computer industry.
        
        <br>
        However, Jobs's tenure at Apple was not without its challenges. He was known for his demanding personality and his perfectionism, and he often clashed with other executives at the company. In 1985, he was forced to resign from Apple after losing a power struggle with the company's board of directors.
        <br>
        After leaving Apple, Jobs founded two new companies: NeXT and Pixar. NeXT was a computer company that developed high-end computers for the education and business markets. Pixar was an animation studio that produced computer-animated films.
        <br>
        NeXT was not a commercial success, but it was influential in the development of new technologies such as the World Wide Web. Pixar, on the other hand, was a huge success. The company's films, including Toy Story, Finding Nemo, and The Incredibles, were groundbreaking, and they won numerous awards.
        <br>
        In 1997, Apple acquired NeXT, and Jobs returned to the company as CEO. Under Jobs's leadership, Apple underwent a remarkable turnaround. The company introduced a series of successful products, including the iMac, iPod, and iPhone, and it became one of the most valuable companies in the world.
        <br>
        Jobs died on October 5, 2011, at the age of 56, after a long battle with cancer. He is considered one of the most influential figures in the history of technology, and his legacy continues to inspire people around the world.</p>
