That is correct. Both methods will achieve the desired result of positioning the "For More Information" anchor tag to the extreme right. The first method uses the `justify-content: space-between` property to evenly space out all anchor tags, while the second method manually sets the `margin-left` property of each anchor tag except the last one.

Ultimately, the choice of method depends on your personal preference and coding style. If you prefer to use CSS classes and properties, then the first method is a good choice. If you prefer to manually set the margin of each anchor tag, then the second method is a good choice.

Here is a summary of the pros and cons of each method:

**Method 1 (Using `justify-content: space-between`):**

**Pros:**

* More concise and reusable CSS code.
* Easier to maintain if you add or remove anchor tags.

**Cons:**

* Does not provide fine-grained control over the spacing between anchor tags.

**Method 2 (Manually setting the margin):**

**Pros:**

* Provides fine-grained control over the spacing between anchor tags.
* Does not require additional CSS classes.

**Cons:**

* More verbose code.
* Requires manual updates if you add or remove anchor tags.

I hope this helps!
